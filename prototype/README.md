# 🌾 Virtual Hedging Platform Prototype

> A blockchain-enabled risk-management system that empowers Indian oilseed farmers and FPOs with **AI-driven price prediction**, **virtual forward contracts**, and **transparent market simulation** tools.

---

## 🧩 Overview
Oilseed farmers in India face severe **price volatility** and lack effective hedging mechanisms due to the suspension of physical commodity futures trading.  
This prototype demonstrates how **AI + Blockchain** can provide a **virtual alternative** — allowing farmers to forecast prices, simulate forward contracts, and build trust in digital transactions.

## 🚀 Features

- 🤖 **AI-Driven Price Forecasting** — Pgitredicts oilseed prices using linear regression on historical market data  
- ⛓️ **Blockchain Ledger Simulation** — Logs forward contracts transparently using cryptographic hashes  
- 📊 **Streamlit Dashboard** — Interactive visualization for prices, forecasts, and blockchain blocks  
- 🧠 **Educational Tool** — Helps farmers understand how hedging and digital contracts work
