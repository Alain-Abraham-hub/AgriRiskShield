🌾 Virtual Hedging Platform for Oilseed Farmers

Empowering Indian farmers with AI-driven price prediction, simulated futures trading, and secure forward contracts.

⸻

Background

Oilseed farmers in India face severe price volatility due to the suspension of commodity trading platforms and lack of effective hedging tools. This leads to distress sales and income instability. Developed markets like the US and Brazil use futures and options to mitigate such risks.

This project aims to simulate a digital risk management platform for farmers, enabling them to make informed decisions and manage market risks virtually.

Project Overview

The platform is a prototype blockchain-based application that allows:
	•	AI-driven price prediction: Predict future oilseed prices using historical data and time-series models.
	•	Simulated futures and forward contracts: Farmers can lock in virtual prices to manage risks.
	•	Transaction security: Blockchain-based ledger records contracts and trades.
	•	Market alerts: Real-time notifications for price trends and contract maturity.
	•	Educational modules: Tutorials to improve financial literacy and risk management understanding.
